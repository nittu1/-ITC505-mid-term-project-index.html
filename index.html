        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>Process and Creative Choices: I developed a fantasy-themed adventure with multiple paths and endings, using a modular structure with JavaScript objects for easy management. The user interface was designed to be intuitive, with clear text descriptions and clickable choices. Image placeholders were included to enhance immersion.</p>
        
        <p>Challenges and Solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Challenge: Maintaining story coherence across multiple paths.
                Solution: Created a flowchart before coding to ensure logical progression.</li>
            <li>Challenge: Implementing restart functionality without page reload.
                Solution: Designed a startGame() function to reset game state and update UI.</li>
            <li>Challenge: Ensuring all paths lead to satisfying conclusions.
                Solution: Crafted multiple endings tied to specific choices for a sense of consequence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Insights Gained:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learned the importance of modular design in managing complex narratives.</li>
            <li>Realized the significance of clear, concise writing in interactive fiction.</li>
            <li>Gained insights into client-side state management.</li>
            <li>Discovered the scalability of the structure for more complex narratives.</li>
            <li>Experienced how coding can be a creative medium for interactive storytelling.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This project enhanced both my JavaScript skills and my understanding of interactive narrative design and user experience in web applications.</p>
